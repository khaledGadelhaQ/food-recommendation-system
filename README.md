# Food Recommendation System
This is a simple food recommendation system built using Prolog. It
works by matching peopleâ€™s favorite cuisines with dishes that belong
to those cuisines. Basically, you tell the system what type of food
you like, and it gives you suggestions of dishes to try.
For example, if Amr loves Italian and Chinese food, the system will
recommend things like pizza, pasta, fried rice, or spring rolls. On the
other hand, if Khaled is into Egyptian food, heâ€™ll get suggestions like
Koshare or Falafel. It's like having a food buddy who knows your
taste! ðŸ˜Š
